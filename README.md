# Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science

### Author of the course: BSc., MSc. Emmanuel Isaac Juárez Caballero
This course aims to provide a comprehensive education on the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and information.

**Prerequisites:**
- Linear Algebra
- Differential and Integral Calculus
- (Suggested) Modern Physics
**Main Bibliography:**

- Quantum Computation
- Introduction to Quantum Information Science
- Introduction

**Deliverables:**

The course consists of 3 assignments, one for each part of the course, which must be submitted no later than one week after the end of each section. The assignments can be found available (as well as the digital content of the course) in this GitHub repository.

The assignments consist of a theoretical evaluation where theorems that are commonly used in quantum computing and relevant to each of the sections are referred to.

In the same way, there is a complement that are simulation tasks, algorithm generation, which can be delivered in the language of preference.

For this course, the use of the following programming languages ​​is proposed for the resolution of tasks, these are recommendations and are not exclusive, that is, you can carry out your implementations in the language of your preference.

- Python
    - Qiskit
    - Pennylane
    - Cirq
- Mathematica
- Julia
